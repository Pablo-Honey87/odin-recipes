    <h2><strong>What Is Pierogi</strong></h2>
    <p>
      Varenyky (perogies) These half moons of dough may be filled with a variety
      of fruits, vegetables, <br />
      meats and cheeses, although for Christmas Eve potato and cabbage fillings
      are the favorite.
    </p>
    <h2><strong> Varenyky Ingredients</strong></h2>

    <ul>
      <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
      <li>1 cup evaporated milk</li>
      <li>½ cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Filling:</strong></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>6 medium potatoes, cut into small cubes</li>
      <li>2 large onions, finely chopped</li>
      <li>½ cup butter</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>How to Make Pierogi</strong></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        To make the dough, combine the flour and salt in a large bowl. Make a
        well in the center and add the soft butter and evaporated milk; <br />
        stir gently until all the liquid is absorbed. Add water only as needed,
        kneading continuously until dough sticks together. <br />
        Place dough into a greased bowl, turn to coat, and let rest for 30
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the potato filling, place potatoes into a saucepan with water to
        cover. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. <br />
        Drain and set aside. Melt 1/2 cup butter in a medium skillet, over
        medium heat. Saute onions in butter until tender. <br />
        Mix the onions into the potatoes along with the cheese and season with
        salt and pepper to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the dough from the bowl onto a lightly floured surface. Roll out
        to 1/8 inch in thickness. <br />
        Cut into 3 inch circles. Place one tablespoon of filling onto one side
        of the circle. <br />
        Fold the other half over and press the edges to seal. Place finished
        dumplings onto a floured tray and keep covered.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Drop 10 or so dumplings into the
        water at a time. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, <br />
        then remove to a colander to drain. Place finished dumplings onto a
        lightly oiled dish and turn them to coat with a thin layer. <br />
        This will keep them from sticking together. Serve dumplings with fried
        onions and sour cream. <br />
        Cooled dumplings also can be fried in oil and butter for a nice crispy
        surface.
