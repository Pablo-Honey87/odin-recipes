    <h2><strong>How to Make Holubtsi</strong></h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place cabbage in a stockpot; pour over enough water to cover. Add 1/4
        teaspoon salt; <br> bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Turn cabbage every
        2 to 3 minutes; <br> transfer any leaves that separate from cabbage into a
        strainer to drain and cool. <br> Continue to boil until all the leaves have
        cooked, about 15 minutes. <br> Reserve 1 1/2 cups of cabbage cooking water.
        Cut out the tough, <br> thick center ribs of any large cabbage leaves with a
        sharp knife.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Mix ground beef, ground pork, cooked rice, eggs, onion, fresh parsley,
        garlic powder, <br> salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined. Lay 1
        cabbage leaf on a flat surface; <br> place 1 heaping tablespoon of filling at
        the base of a cabbage leaf. <br> Overlap with the bottom of the leaf; fold in
        side edges and roll up.
      </li>
      <li>Repeat with remaining large cabbage leaves and filling.</li>
      <li>
        Cut any leftover cabbage leaves into pieces and place in the bottom of a
        roasting pan. <br> Layer stuffed cabbage rolls on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine tomato sauce, reserved cabbage water, white vinegar, and white
        sugar in a bowl; <br> pour mixture over cabbage rolls. Cover roasting pan
        with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until filling is cooked through and sauce has
        thickened, <br> about 2 1/2 hours. Baste stuffed cabbage rolls every hour.
      </li>
